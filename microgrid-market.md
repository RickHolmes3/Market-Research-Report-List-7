<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microgrid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Grid-Tied</li><li>Independent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Microgrid market types include grid-tied and independent systems. Grid-tied microgrids are connected to the main power grid, allowing for bi-directional energy flow, enabling them to draw power when needed and sell excess energy back to the grid. Independent microgrids operate autonomously, generating and managing their own power without reliance on the larger grid, often utilizing renewable sources. Each type serves different needs: grid-tied for flexibility and stability, while independent microgrids focus on resilience and self-sufficiency.</p></p>
